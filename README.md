## Update 5.17.2017: 

Firebase phone authentication is the next evolution of Digits. You can now let your users sign in with their phone numbers, in addition to traditional email/password or identity providers like Google or Facebook. This gives you a comprehensive authentication solution no matter who your users are or how they like to log in. Learn more about [Firebase phone authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/).

## If you currently use Digits: 

Upgrade to Firebase phone authentication for an even more powerful and reliable service that gives you faster user growth. The Digits SDK and Digits.com will be retired on September 30, 2017. Learn more on the [Digits blog](http://get.digits.com/blog/introducing-firebase-phone-authentication).
